# WBS-Kanban-Gantt
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
The Work Breakdown Structure for my website project divides the project into five distinct phases: Planning, Design, Development, Testing & Deployment, and Marketing & Maintenance. Each phase is further broken down into specific deliverables and tasks that are actionable and measurable, ensuring that no aspect of the project is overlooked. The rationale behind this grouping is to manage complexity and ensure that each task can be tracked and completed before moving to the next phase. Key deliverables such as "Design Homepage & Product Pages" and "Deploy Website Live" mark significant milestones in the project, with each task being dependent on the completion of the prior one. Assumptions include that the website will be developed using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend for database functionality) and that testing will involve user feedback and debugging. The WBS provides clarity on the scope of work and a structured approach for project execution.

Gantt Chart 
The Gantt chart for my website project provides a visual timeline that illustrates the project’s task durations and dependencies. It allows for clear scheduling and helps manage time by identifying when each task starts and ends. Key observations from the chart include the sequential nature of many tasks, such as "Create Wireframes & Mockups" followed by "Design Homepage & Product Pages," which requires the completion of earlier design work. Resource constraints are identified in tasks like "Set up Frontend (HTML, CSS)" and "Develop Backend," where overlapping tasks may strain resources or require additional team members. Prioritization is based on dependencies, where critical design and development tasks are scheduled before testing and deployment to ensure that the foundation of the website is stable before finalizing the project.

Kanban Board 
The Kanban board provides a visual tool to manage the project's tasks and track their progress across different stages, from "Backlog" to "Done." By organizing tasks into clear categories such as "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Done," the board allows the project team to easily see which tasks are waiting to be started, which are actively being worked on, and which have been completed. This system helps identify bottlenecks in the workflow, such as tasks that have been in "In Progress" for an extended period, signaling the need for additional resources or attention. Overall, the Kanban board fosters transparency, enhances team collaboration, and allows for better management of the project’s workload, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and in a timely manner.
